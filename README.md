//ZSIGMA'S (/U/UBERKRANG) ENTRY FRAGGING SCRIPT (dust2)
//INSPIRED BY PRE-AIM SCRIPTS BY /U/99SBJ
//EDITED BY WekizZ

In game
WARNING: This script will bind F1-F12, ALT. If you use those keys, rebind them (in the BINDS! section).
How to use:
You must have the developer console enabled in options.
Start a server (offline with bots) on dust2 in casual mode.
You must join T-Side.
Kick bots by typing "bot_kick" in console if there is bots ;).
Execute the script by typing "exec entry_dust2" 2 times (1 time bugs a bot out for some reason), after you can use key F8 to refresh the config.
Set up the bot trace by pressing the BINDS FOR MANUAL TRACE keys with about a second between (default F5).
Press the "bot_stop 1" key (default F6) to check the bots are tracing (and prevent a bug where the bots move a bit after placing).
If not all bots are tracing repeat or stand in the front of the bots not tracing and enter "bot_stop 0" into the console.
When all bots are tracing use ENTRY BINDS to place the bots (and yourself) for entryfragging training (see the BINDS! section in the cfg).
NEW! Click the ENTRY BIND few times to mix the spawn bot locations and check the chat to know how many bots are spawned.
NEW! Click "F7" will activate bot to shoot and move as soon as you shoot, don't spray - bot will run away :D. 
NEW! Addon for active bots, lower your health with F1-F4 buttons to make it more competitive.
You have to make the bots trace after each run, as re-spawned bots don't trace automatically.
If you want to switch weapons, simply buy from the buy menu.
If you run out of money execute the script again or set "mp_death_drop_gun 1" and use the "give weapon" command
Edit the alias below (aimhelp) if you use custom key binds (so you don't forget them!).
